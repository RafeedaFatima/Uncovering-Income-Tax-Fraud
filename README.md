# Uncovering-Income-Tax-Fraud
my project addresses the challenge of income tax fraud detection by developing a machine learning model that analyzes financial data to identify fraudulent activities. I compared six machine learning algorithms and found logistic regression to be the most effective in detecting tax fraud. Unlike existing methods, the model captures both linear and non-linear relationships among variables, enabling accurate detection of complex patterns. The research objectives include comparing the effectiveness of various algorithms and identifying significant factors contributing to tax fraud. Additionally, the best performing model is deployed into Android Studio to develop a prediction app using TensorFlow, enhancing its practical usability.
